				The Artificial Life Institute stands at the intersection of cutting-edge computer science and nature's 
				most profound creative force: evolution. We don't follow predetermined paths like most traditional AIs. 
				Instead, we harness open-endednessâ€”nature's grandest achievement that created a path from single 
				cells to intelligent life, from the discovery of fire to exploring outer space, from primitive tools to 
				artificial intelligence.
			</p>
			
			<p class="text-20px" style="line-height: 2;">
				Founded by <span class="font-semibold text-primary underline">world-class researchers</span> and <span class="font-semibold text-primary underline">business leaders</span>, we are dedicated to advancing research 
				and driving business innovations. Our work spans from microscopic digital organisms to complex 
				evolutionary simulations that could reshape how we understand intelligence itself.
			</p>
			
			<p class="text-20px" style="line-height: 2;">
				Based in Kyoto, we bring together brilliant minds who see beyond the current AI paradigm, building the 
				foundation for a world where humans and artificial life forms co-evolve, creating possibilities neither 
				could achieve alone. For complete transparency about our operations and commitment to your privacy,
